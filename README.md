## Project Overview [Sleep, Health & Lifestyle]
This project explores the relationship between sleep patterns, physical activity, stress, and health outcomes using a rich dataset of 374 individuals. It aims to uncover behavioral and occupational trends that influence sleep disorders and overall well-being.


## üìä Data Source  
- The data was sourced from Kaggle


## üõ† Tools Used
Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, summary statistics and Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling


## Data Processing
All processing was carried out in Excel using formulas, PivotTables, and built-in tools. The workflow included:

- Data Import
Imported the dataset into Excel from CSV/Excel format.

- Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates and blank rows.
Standardized categorical variables (e.g., merged inconsistent entries like ‚ÄúMgr‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúManager‚Äùand "Dr" ‚Üí "Doctor" ).
Checked for missing or unrealistic values (e.g., sleep duration <3 hrs or >12 hrs, steps <500 or >20,000).

- Data Transformation
  
- Data Analysis
Built PivotTables to aggregate metrics by gender, occupation, and other categories.
Calculated KPIs such as:
Average Sleep Duration = 7.13 hrs
Average Steps Taken = 6816.84
Total Physical Activity = 22,130

- Data Visualization
Designed an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers (Gender, Occupation, Sleep Disorder).
Used bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards to display:
Gender distribution
Sleep disorder by gender
Occupational stress levels
Steps and sleep comparisons
Quality of sleep distribution


## üß† Skills Demonstrated
- Data transformation

- Data processing
  
- Data analysis & Visualization

- Critical thinking and Problem solving
  

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze sleep duration and quality across demographics and professions

- Identify correlations between lifestyle factors (e.g., stress, activity level) and sleep disorders

- Segment population by health indicators like BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate

- Provide actionable recommendations for improving sleep health
  
- To uncover trends, risk factors, and potential indicators of sleep disorders to support data-driven public health and personal wellness recommendations.

‚Äì Gender & Occupation Focus
This dashboard reveals how gender and occupation influence sleep quality, stress, and physical activity.

- üß† Sleep Quality & Disorders
Females report better sleep quality, with more scoring 8‚Äì9 on the scale.

Insomnia affects both genders equally, while sleep apnea is more prevalent in males.

Over 40% of individuals experience some form of sleep disorder, highlighting a widespread issue.

- üë©‚Äç‚öï Occupational Stress
Nurses face the highest stress levels (478), followed by doctors and engineers.

Stress appears strongly linked to sleep disorders, especially in caregiving roles.

- üë£ Physical Activity
Males take slightly more steps on average, but the gap is minimal‚Äîsuggesting similar activity levels across genders.

- üë• Gender Representation
Women dominate roles like nursing, teaching, and accounting, while men are more represented in engineering and law. This occupational split may influence lifestyle patterns, stress exposure, and sleep outcomes.


## Insights
- Sleep Disorders: 42% of individuals suffer from either insomnia or sleep apnea

- Gender Split: Fairly balanced (185 females, 189 males), but sleep quality slightly higher in females

- Occupation Impact: Nurses and Salespersons show higher stress and sleep disorder prevalence

- Activity vs. Sleep: Higher physical activity correlates with better sleep quality and fewer disorders

- BMI & Blood Pressure: Overweight individuals show elevated blood pressure and higher disorder rates

- Daily Steps: Average is ~6,800 steps/day, with males slightly more active than females
  

## Recommendations
- Targeted Wellness Programs: Focus on high-risk professions like nursing and sales

- Stress Management: Introduce mindfulness and physical activity routines for stressed groups

- Sleep Hygiene Education: Promote consistent sleep schedules and screen-time reduction

- Occupational Health Monitoring: Regular checkups for high-BMI and high-blood-pressure groups

- Data-Driven Interventions: Use dashboards to guide personalized health coaching
