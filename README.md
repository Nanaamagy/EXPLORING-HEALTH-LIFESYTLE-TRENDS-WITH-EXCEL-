## Project Overview [Sleep, Health & Lifestyle]
This project explores the relationship between sleep patterns, physical activity, stress, and health outcomes using a rich dataset of 374 individuals. It aims to uncover behavioral and occupational trends that influence sleep disorders and overall well-being.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze sleep duration and quality across demographics and professions

- Identify correlations between lifestyle factors (e.g., stress, activity level) and sleep disorders

- Segment population by health indicators like BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate

- Provide actionable recommendations for improving sleep health
  
- To uncover trends, risk factors, and potential indicators of sleep disorders to support data-driven public health and personal wellness recommendations.

## Insights
- Sleep Disorders: 42% of individuals suffer from either insomnia or sleep apnea

- Gender Split: Fairly balanced (185 females, 189 males), but sleep quality slightly higher in females

- Occupation Impact: Nurses and Salespersons show higher stress and sleep disorder prevalence

- Activity vs. Sleep: Higher physical activity correlates with better sleep quality and fewer disorders

– Gender & Occupation Focus
This dashboard reveals how gender and occupation influence sleep quality, stress, and physical activity.

- 🧠 Sleep Quality & Disorders
Females report better sleep quality, with more scoring 8–9 on the scale.

Insomnia affects both genders equally, while sleep apnea is more prevalent in males.

Over 40% of individuals experience some form of sleep disorder, highlighting a widespread issue.

- 👩‍⚕ Occupational Stress
Nurses face the highest stress levels (478), followed by doctors and engineers.

Stress appears strongly linked to sleep disorders, especially in caregiving roles.

- 👣 Physical Activity
Males take slightly more steps on average, but the gap is minimal—suggesting similar activity levels across genders.

- 👥 Gender Representation
Women dominate roles like nursing, teaching, and accounting, while men are more represented in engineering and law.
This occupational split may influence lifestyle patterns, stress exposure, and sleep outcomes.
